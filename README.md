**Description:**

We intend to explore and answer questions about how weather, time of day, precipitation, geolocation, and other external factors lead to an increase of accidents in the US.  Our particular interest is finding a correlation between why an accident might be more likely to occur near a certain location vs another, during extreme weather instances vs not, or during daytime rush hour vs nighttime low visibility.

**Summary of Questions:**

*What driving conditions are the most hazardous?*

High wind speed and poor visibility held the highest probability of a minor accident.

With the addition of several other conditions such as time of day being Night or freezing temperature the Bayesian Classification predicts car accidents under these conditions will most likely be severe. Indeed, this confirms our hypothesis that weather conditions and nighttime driving have a positive correlation with an increase in the severity of accidents. Drawing inferences from these results, we can conclude that because most accidents are not weather-related, a majority are not as severe. 

*How has traffic accident volume changed with time?*

It is evident through our Time Series analysis of Accidents over years and accidents by hour, that more cars on the road often leads to more accidents. During the start of quarantine during 2020, there was a massive drop in accidents. This was likely due to the lack of cars on the road. It is also evident through our hourly accident count that accidents appear to occur significantly more between 6 am to 6 pm which is typically considered standard work hours. Traffic accidents peak between 7 - 9 am and 4 - 6 pm or "rush hour". In our weekend vs weekday chart, there are significantly fewer accidents during weekends likely due to fewer commuters. We see a spike on weekend accidents in the early afternoon which may be due to weekend sleeping habits.


*What locations have the most traffic accidents?*

City centers, highways, and interstates have the most accidents. Large population centers with sprawled amenities and a need to travel by car had a significant portion as well.

Using a Heat Map we were able to see the geographic frequency of accidents in the United States and adjust our map to counties and cities with the highest frequency of accidents. For example, Los Angeles County, CA was high on the list; most of the accidents occured on the highways and interstate so much so that you can clearly identify the roads on a map. With the knowledge gained from utilizing the heat map, location data can be gained and utilized by local and state governments to create informed initiatives that can reduce traffic and reallocate resources to enhance road safety and mitigate accident risks in known problematic areas.


**Application of Knowledge:**

This knowledge could be useful in determining what conditions are more dangerous for driving. This knowledge could be very helpful for cities building new roads or for proposing new systems of transportation.
