**Description:**
We intend to explore and answer questions about how weather, time of day, precipitation, geolocation, and other external factors lead to an increase of accidents in the US.  Our particular interest is finding a correlation between why an accident might be more likely to occur near a certain location vs another, during extreme weather instances vs not, or during daytime rush hour vs nighttime low visibility.

**Summary of Questions:**
What driving conditions are the most hazerdous?
How has traffic accident volume changed with time?
What locations have the most traffic accidents?

**Application of Knowledge:**
This knowledge could be useful in determining what conditions are more dangerous for driving. This knowledge could be very helpful for cities building new roads or for proposing new systems of transportation.
